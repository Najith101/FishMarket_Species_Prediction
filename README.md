# FishMarket Species Prediction

## Objective

The project was created to classify the Fish Species using their attribues.The dataset is a record of 7 common different fish species in fish market sales.
Machine learning is used to achieve the project objective.In this project, thefish we are trying to predict is of seven fish breeds. They are namely,
